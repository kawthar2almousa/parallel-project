# parallel-project
both codes are included for the purpose of a project done for ARTI 503 course-parallel programming course
both codes are inspired from privously established code on bubble and selection sort being parallalized using c and cpp
both are implemented using openmp

link to original bubble parallalized : https://gist.github.com/vnkdj5/bbcbd4e55be914ffa71052830e72ce19
few additions and changes were made to the codes and they are presented in our paper named "Parallelizing Selection and Bubble Sort Algorithms"
